# Morty Mercenaries for D2RMM

D2RMM port of the [Morty Mercenaries](https://www.nexusmods.com/diablo2resurrected/mods/476) mod by [Caleb & Friends](https://www.nexusmods.com/diablo2resurrected/users/171503373).

Renames all mercenaries to Morty, uses "Evil Morty" icon (sprite) & uses Morty's voice for dying, getting hit, giving gear & giving potions. _"I can't use that"_ & _"I can't use that yet"_ are default.
